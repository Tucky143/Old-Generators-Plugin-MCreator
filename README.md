# Old-Generators-Plugin-MCreator
This Github repository is made with the purpose of joining the community of MCreator plugin developers to create one big plugin. The plugin is mainly for adding support for older MCreator / Minecraft versions into the current version, but can be changed and features can be added to developers likings.
